The client wants an campus management system app where TUDelft students and staff can make an account and book rooms. Teachers should have a bigger variety of rooms like presentation rooms, exam rooms etc. Every building on the campus has a food court so additionally the people in the rooms can order food via the platform. The client also wants a system admin side on which he can manage almost anything (add, change and remove reservations, accounts, building etc.).
